# bookmark-manager

-- Show a List of Bookmarks --

As a User,
so that I can see what I have bookmarked,
I would like to see a list of my bookmarks.

Domain Model
Bookmarks (class) -> view (method)

The Bookmarks class stores all the bookmarks, while the view is the method that lists all the bookmarks.
